            Currently, the electricity situation in our country is very bad.
            Electricity goes out all day, so as an extra backup we should keep
            reserved electricity and our company is providing extra collected
            electricity. If you want you can pay your electricity bill through
            our site. Click the below button to pay the electricity bill
